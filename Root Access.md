# Getting root Access

On Linux there are 2 main categories of users:

1. non-privileged users - have no special rights on the system.
2. The root user (superuser or the administrator).

- Root privileges are the powers that the root account has on the system. The root account is the most privileged on the system and has absolute power over it.
- Root exists on any Linux system is there’s only one.
- It’s not recommended to use root for ordinary tasks. When root permissions are needed you simply become root only to perform that particular administrative task.
